## 📖 Overview

The Dev-Op Project is a web-based application designed to demonstrate the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances. This project integrates a simple web application with CI/CD practices to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
